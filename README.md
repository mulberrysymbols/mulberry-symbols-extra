# mulberry-symbols-extra

Additional formats to the svg files in the main [mulberry-symbols](https://github.com/straight-street/mulberry-symbols) repo.

The symbols were originally designed in Adobe Illustrator (ai) and exported to the other formats here and svg. We now treat the svg as the master format and those here are for historical information. 

We recommend using the svg in all cases as they are scalable and SVG is finally well supported on the web and other platforms. If you *really* need othe formats then tere are various conversion tools available.
